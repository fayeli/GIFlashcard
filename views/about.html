<p> Learning a foreign language is no easy matter. As an ESL student, I have experienced first-hand the struggles in acquiring vocabulary of a foreign language. "There are too many of them!", "This is boring", "Why do they all look so unfamiliar and difficult?" are the most common reactions amongst my peers when given a list of vocabulary for studying. Students are getting discouraged too early. They are associating learning vocabulary with frustration and disappointment. As a result, the learning outcomes are not that great.

<p>
My proposed concept is to address the problem of vocabulary learning with a fun and engaging learning tool. Students learn the best when they are interested and passionate about what they are doing. It would be an incredible boast if learning vocabulary is associated with fun.

How can we spark the fun and enhance learning at the same time? Studies have shown that we can remember a lot more effectively by association, that is, by linking new information with old information, which is in long term memory. For example, if students are given a new word with an image, the word is more likely to be processed and stored by their brains because they were already familiar with the visuals. This is why vocabulary flashcards are so commonly used within language learners.

My proposed concept is to take the use of flashcards a step further by adding interactivity and animated GIFs. Learners will be able to create and share their own flashcards made with their favourite GIFs. The Pearson's Dictionaries API will be used for retrieving translations of vocabulary. I believe that this vocabulary learning tool will bring fun and successful learning outcome. Because who doesn't like GIFs?!
